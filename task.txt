The task is small but it is important to treat it seriously and supply 
a production quality code. If youâ€™re uncertain about any details of the project,
 feel free to render your own decisions.

General Description

Test task is to create code for simplified billing of a mobile network operator.
We use the following rules for calculating call cost:
- Fixed connection fee of 0.33 that is added to any call cost. 
- Minute fee is charged at the beginning of each minute, so if call 
duration is 1:03, two minutes cost should be paid 
- Each subscriber has 30 minutes of free talking inside his operator network, 
valid for 30 days since the date when last credit was added. 
- After free minutes expire, calls inside home operator network are charged 
0.50 per minute. 
- When calling numbers outside of home network, minute cost is 0.95. 
- On weekends, first five minutes of every call are free.
We define home network of the operator as a set of phone numbers starting with 
one of the given prefixes (050, 066, 095, and 099).
Your main objective is to create code calculating call cost, given date and 
time for its start and end, number called, and subscriber account information. 
Please make your code readable and easy to configure, maintain and modify. 
We expect some kind of demo application allowing testing your code with some 
example data, but do not make it overly complicated.

Deliverables

Please supply full source code of your solution. Make sure you do not use any 
platform-specific libraries or implementation-specific language features. 
If you have any supplementary code, such as unit tests, please include it. 
Please provide build scripts which were used for compilation and detailed 
instructions how to use them.
All source codes, scripts, instructions and binaries separated from user 
options and project DBs and sent in one archive.
Alternatively you can publish your solution on GitHub.
